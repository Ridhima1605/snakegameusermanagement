## Features
- User login and registration.
- High-score tracking per user.
- Classic Snake game mechanics with increasing difficulty.
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game reimagined with modern web technologies. As part of our group project, We developed the interactive Snake Game using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This version of the game features a clean and responsive design, a smooth user experience, and is integrated with a user management system to track scores.
Key Features:
Game Mechanics: The snake moves across a grid, growing longer as it consumes food items. The goal is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself, while aiming to achieve the highest possible score.

Responsive Layout: Designed with Bootstrap, the game interface adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

User Registration and Login: Users can create an account, log in, and track their high scores. This allows users to see their progress over time and ensures a personalized gaming experience
